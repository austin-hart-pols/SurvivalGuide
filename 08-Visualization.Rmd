# Basic visualization

Note that you will need the `dcps` data (`"DCPS testing.RData"`) to replicate the commands.

## Graphing in base R
Data visualization is a notable strength of R, and its native (`base`) capabilities allow you to create high quality, straightforward graphs.

### Describe one variable
Summarizing briefly what we presented in prior chapters, presenting data on a single variable is primarily a matter of understanding what type of measure you have. Using the `dcps` data: 

```{r basesum1, eval=TRUE, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
# Histogram (numeric X)
  hist(dcps$NumTested)
  
# Boxplot (numeric X)  
  boxplot(dcps$ProfMath, horizontal = TRUE)

# Bar plot (nominal X)
  # 1. relative frequency table
    tab = 
      dcps %>%
      count(SchType) %>%
      mutate(Percent = 100 * n/sum(n))
    
  # 2. barplot from table
    barplot(Percent ~ SchType, data = tab)
```

### Visualizing relationships
For visualizing relationships between variables:

```{r basesum2, eval=TRUE, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
# Group comparison (numeric X, nominal Y)
  boxplot(NumTested ~ SchType, data = dcps)
  
# Scatter plot (numeric X, numeric Y)
  plot(ProfLang ~ SchType, data = dcps)

# Scatter w/OLS fit (numeric X, numeric Y)
  # 1. store OLS estimates
    est = lm(ProfLang ~ ProfMath, data = dcps)
  # 2. plot  
    plot(ProfLang ~ ProfMath, data = dcps) # scatter
    abline(est) # add linear fit
```

## Professional formatting
Formatting is what differentiates an exploratory graph from one you would present to others. The options for formatting an R graphic are almost limitless. However, of special importance are the descriptive text (e.g. titles), axis scales, and the graphical parameters (e.g. color and shape of the points).

I suggest the [Quick-R Advanced Graphs page](https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/index.html) for more details and for more advanced examples.

### Titles and labels
Within the different plotting functions, you can specify the main title (`main =`), axis labels (e.g. `xlab =`), and more. Choose simple, descriptive labels and titles.

```{r titles,eval=TRUE, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
  hist(dcps$ProfLang,
       main = "Language Proficiency, DCPS 2018",
       xlab = 'Grade-level proficient (% tested)', ylab = 'Frequency')
```

### Axis options
Sometimes the axis scales that R chooses don't make sense or fail to communicate effectively. In these cases, we want to format the endpoints, or limits, of each axis scale. You do this using `xlim` and `ylim`, which allow you to specify a custom minimum and maximum value on each axis (e.g. `xlim = c(min,max)`). Note that you must provide both using the appropriate syntax.

```{r axes,eval=TRUE, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
  plot(ProfLang ~ NumTested, data = dcps,
       xlim = c(0,1500), ylim = c(0,100)) # boundaries on X and Y
```

### Graphical parameters
Basic R graphs are clean and sparse; these are important advantages. However, we may want to spice things up beyond the simple black and white. This is especially true in graphs with multiple components (e.g. a scatter plot with linear fit) where color/shape contrast is important to differentiate the elements. See below examples of changing fill color (`col`), border color (`border`), point shape (`pch`), line type (`lty`), and line width (`lwd`).

```{r gparms,eval=TRUE, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
# Histogram (or boxplot)
  hist(dcps$ProfMath,
       col = 'deeppink4', # fill color
       border = 'gray25') # broder color

# Scatter plots with fit
  plot(ProfMath ~ ProfLang, data = dcps,
       pch = 24,    # shape of the point
       col = 'red') # point color
  
  abline(lm(ProfMath ~ ProfLang, data = dcps), 
         col = 'cornflowerblue',
         lty = 4, # line type (1-6)
         lwd = 3) # line width (3=triple width)
```

## Exporting/saving graphs
Once you have a formatted graph, it's time to export it. Find the `Export` button in the plot window and choose "Save as Image" (left-hand panel of the figure below). This opens the window shown in the right-hand panel. Here you want to select an appropriate format (typically `.jpeg`), name, and size. Size is crucial, and the target is the smallest possible without cutting out text. A size of 450x400 pixels is a pretty safe bet for most of what we do in this course.

```{r gphsave, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width = '85%',fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Fortmat and export graphs"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\ahart\\Dropbox\\SIS 600 AH\\SurvivalGuide\\gphexport.jpg")
```
